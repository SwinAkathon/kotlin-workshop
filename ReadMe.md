The purpose of this workshop is to teach how to develop Android apps in Kotlin that uses the latest features of the language. 

The original target audience of the workshop are students participating in [Akathon4AIoT](https://fb.me/e/3zDMO0U1l) at Swinburne Vietnam. More generally, however, the workshop would be suitable for anyone who:
- has a basic knowledge in Kotlin and 
- is familiar with how to use Android Studio to develop a Kotlin app. 

The workshop includes **two modules**:

| Module | Title | Features | Outcomes | 
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 01 | Frontend Development with Jetpack Compose | Jetpack Compose essentials | Full navigation app | 
| 02 | Processing Large Datasets | Kotlin Flow, LiveData, Paging | Data Processing app |  

This github consists of several branches, containing different apps and their versions. A subset of these are used in the workshop. Others are available for extra references.
